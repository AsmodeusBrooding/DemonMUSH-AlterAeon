DemonMUSH Changelog: September 5th, 2020

~R~HSound
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
~WAdded MSP support and a new sound plugin which automatically downloads
/and plays msp sounds from the Alter Aeon website.
I've set a cap at 1.4MB for any single file, so let me know if you get
a warning about it trying to download something bigger. I'm not currently
aware of the largest file size for the sound files. The files are in wav
format by default, which are typically larger than mp3 or ogg.
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

~R~HMapper 
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
~WImproved Cave Terrain icon.
General cleanup of code to prepare for some awesome new features.
Added code to toggle a display of notes on the map window.
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

~R~HString_Handler 
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
~WAdded more gags to reduce spammy kxwt information.
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

~R~HEXP Tracker 
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
~WAdded on/off toggle, use dxp on or dxp off instead of just dxp, so you 
don't accidentally flip it off.

Improved overall aesthetics massively.
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

~R~HDiscord
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
~WWe can now chat with people on Discord using the Discord mud channel.
%con discord to be able to talk with people off the mud, and connect to
our server at https://discord.gg/tqngxFp to be able to talk with people
on the mud from off the mud!

I'm thinking about making the auction channel viewable from off the game.
I have added the REBOOT IMPENDING message as well. Let me know what kind
of messages/alerts you might want to see on discord while you're off the 
mud! Some have recommended fishing derby and clan wars. Please weigh in!
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

~R~HCommunication Catcher 
~Y------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
~WRemoved channel prefix [] from showing up in the chat window.
This prefix is required to help pick up channels with alternative
formatting, but has now been gagged.
Improved regular expression to not pick up tells from shopkeepers, or
says from random mobs.
Updated the 'chat help' and 'commcheck' commands massively, but this
is still under construction. This will end up allowing you to assign
certain channels to certain tabs, and/or mute one, many, or all channels
from the main output, so that they only appear in the chat window.
This would help to reduce spam from your main output window.
