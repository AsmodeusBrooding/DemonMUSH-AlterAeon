Here is the initial git repository for your stuff.

I would recommend that you put your mushclient tree under the
DemonMUSH directory.  If we do the same thing as with mush-z,
that will form the basis of your download and update tree.

This root directory will be used for management and other
stuff.

We only create branches on the main server for major releases.
HEAD is generally where the most current beta lives.

As with mush-z, the stable updater will update to the most
recent stable branch, while the beta updater updates to HEAD.
